## Build and install Bigtop Manager by dev-support
Dev support is used to quickly develop and test bigtop-manager, which runs on the docker containers.
Following steps are based on RockyLinux-8.

### **Step 1**: Install build tools: Git、Docker
The scripts require docker to be installed, since the compile process will run in a docker container and Bigtop-Manager cluster also deploys on containers.

**RHEL (Rocky 8) :**
```shell
yum install -y git docker
```
### **Step 2**: Download Bigtop Manager source
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kevinw66/bigtop-manager.git
```
> You need to change the `node.version` in the `pom.xml` file under the `bigtop-manager-ui` module to `16.x` if you are using CentOS-7.

### **Step 3**: Enter workspace
**RHEL (Rocky 8) :**
```shell
cd bigtop-manager/dev-support/docker/rocky8/
```
### **Step 4**: Build develop basic image
Run the setup command, you will get `bigtop-manager/develop:trunk-rocky-8` image. It has the enviroment needed to compile Bigtop-Manager and run servers such as Bigtop-Manager Server, Bigtop-Manager Agent, Mysql, etc.

**RHEL (Rocky 8) :**
```shell
./build-image.sh
```
### **Step 5**: Build source & create cluster
* Bigtop Manager UI、Bigtop Manager Server Debug Port、MariaDB Server are also exposed to local ports: 8080、5005、3306.
* Docker hostnames are: bigtop-manager-server、bigtop-manager-agent-01、bigtop-manager-agent-02.

**RHEL (Rocky 8) :**
```shell
./build-containers.sh
```
### **Step 6**: Insert data to Database
Copy SQL on `dev-support/example/bigtop_manager/user.sql` and run on mysql database `bigtop_manager` which is installed in container bigtop-manager-server.
### **Step 7**: Access Web UI
Now you can access Web UI which exposes on `http://localhost:8080`. Log in with username `admin` and password `admin`.
### **Step 8**: Clear cluster
Clean up the containers when you are done developing or testing.

**RHEL (Rocky 8) :**
```shell
./clear-containers.sh
```
