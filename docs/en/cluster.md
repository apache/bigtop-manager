## Create a Cluster
This section describes how to create a cluster.

### Basic Information
When creating a cluster, users need to fill in the following information:
- **Name**: The unique identifier of the cluster, a key information for the code to recognize the cluster.
- **DisplayName**: The display name of the cluster, shown on the page for users to distinguish.
- **Description**: A detailed description of the cluster.
- **Root Directory**: The address where cluster services are installed. Corresponding service directories will be created here. For example, if this is `/opt`, ZooKeeper will be installed under `/opt/services/zookeeper`.
- **User Group**: The user group for cluster services. A separate username will be created for each service. If this is `hadoop`, the file permissions for ZooKeeper will be `zookeeper:hadoop`.

### Stack
The stack page is a display page that mainly shows which optional services are available for subsequent installation.

Currently, the Bigtop stack provides tarball files generated by Apache Bigtop instead of rpm/deb packages.

Expect for our official repository, users can also set their own repository which can configured here(due to license issue, MySQL/Grafana in Infra Stack are downloaded from the official website instead of the repository).

We also provide other ways for you download dependencies:

### Hosts
#### Add a Host
When adding a host, the following information needs to be filled in:
- **Username**: The user on the host.
- **Authentication Method**: Authentication method (password/key/no authentication).
- **Hostname**: Hostname, supporting batch addition such as `host-0[1-2]`.
- **Agent Path**: The path where the Agent is installed. If this is `/opt`, the Agent directory will be `/opt/bigtop-manager-agent`.
- **SSH Port**: The port used by the host's SSHD.
- **GRPC Port**: The port where the Agent's gRPC service is exposed as desired by the user.
- **Description**: Host description.

#### Install Dependencies
After entering the host information and before proceeding to the next step, users need to install dependencies, i.e., install the agent application on the corresponding host.

Users can only proceed to the next step if all hosts are installed successfully. Otherwise, they need to fix the errors or remove the hosts where installation failed.

### Create
Finally, wait for the cluster to be created successfully. If it fails, resolve the issues and retry.
